 * COLOR GRADE — a single cinematic grade laid over the WHOLE comp (speaker +
 * b-roll alike) so the piece reads as one graded film, not a speaker clip
 * with stock cutaways pasted on.
 *
 * Three restrained layers, top-down:
 *   1. duotone wash — warm in the highlights, cool in the shadows, via a
 *      soft-light blend. The filmic "warm/cool" separation, dialed way back.
 *   2. vignette — a soft radial darkening that pulls the eye to centre.
 *   3. (contrast/saturation lift is applied as a `filter` on the comp root
 *      in EditedVideo — see GRADE_FILTER — because a blend layer can't add
 *      contrast to what's beneath it.)
 *
 * Tuned to be felt, not seen. If you can point at "the filter", it's too
 * strong — back it off. This is a grade, not an Instagram preset.
