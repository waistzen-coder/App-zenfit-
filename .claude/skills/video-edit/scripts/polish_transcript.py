"""
Use Claude to catch context-aware transcription errors in words.json.

Whisper makes phonetically-similar substitutions ("filled"/"failed",
"skill"/"scale", "routine"/"routing", "Claude"/"Cloud", etc.) that the
deterministic substitution layer in transcribe.py can't catch — those
require context to disambiguate. This script sends the full transcript
text to Claude with a prompt that knows the speaker's domain (see
TRANSCRIPT_SPEAKER_CONTEXT below) and applies high-confidence corrections
back into words.json.

Each correction must be a single-token substitution (replaces one
words.json entry with one new word) so timestamps stay correct.
Multi-word fixes are rejected — those need re-transcription.

Usage:
  polish_transcript.py <words.json>

Customize for your own content by setting the TRANSCRIPT_SPEAKER_CONTEXT
env var (or editing SPEAKER_CONTEXT_DEFAULT below) to a short description
of your channel's topic — it's substituted into the system prompt so the
model's mishearing corrections are grounded in your actual vocabulary.

Idempotent: corrections that already match are no-ops. Logs every fix
applied for audit. Does nothing if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY isn't set.

The Cloud→Claude pass in transcribe.py runs FIRST (deterministic, free).
This polish layer is AFTER, so it sees the already-cleaned transcript
and only flags the harder context-dependent errors.

You receive a Whisper transcript that has already had cloud→claude substituted. \
Your job: find OTHER likely mishearings using context. Common patterns in this \
domain:
- 'failed' misheard as 'filled' / 'feel' / 'felt'
- 'skill' misheard as 'scale' / 'school'
- 'routine' misheard as 'routing'
- 'agent' misheard as 'engine' / 'agents'
- 'prompt' misheard as 'prom'
- 'commit' misheard as 'comet'
- 'shipped' misheard as 'shaped' / 'shipped'
- 'Niden' / 'eight n' meaning 'n8n' (the workflow tool)

Return ONLY a JSON array of corrections, each with:
- word_index: integer index in the words array (0-based)
- wrong: the current word value at that index (verbatim)
- right: the corrected word value (single token; preserve trailing punctuation)
- confidence: "high" — REQUIRED literal value; only include this entry at all if you are >90% confident
- reason: one short sentence explaining the context cue. Must NOT contain words \
like 'unsure', 'uncertain', 'skipping', 'might', 'could be', 'however', 'maybe', \
'possibly', 'or' — those mean you're not confident enough to fix it.

If you're not >90% confident on a candidate, DO NOT include it. Return [] if \
nothing meets the bar. NO commentary outside the JSON array."""
