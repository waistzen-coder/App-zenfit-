align_transcript_to_script.py — use the canonical script to fix BRAND /
BUSINESS NAMES in the transcript, and nothing else.

The policy
----------
A recorded VO tends to follow its script loosely: sentences get rephrased,
some are skipped, but the script still leads. It carries the core message and
the correct business names, so treat it as the authority on those alone.

So the spoken AUDIO is the truth about WHAT WAS SAID — an ad-libbed "ten"
stays "ten" even if the script wrote "eleven". The SCRIPT is the truth
about one thing only: the spelling of proper nouns / brand names Whisper
cannot know ("Hermes Agent", "Bolt", "OpenClaw", "Lovable", "v0").

  in:  <workdir>/words.json   — Whisper output [{word,start,end}, ...]
       <workdir>/script.txt   — canonical script (raw DB `script` field)
  out: <workdir>/words.json   — same transcript, misheard brand names
                                 swapped to their canonical spelling
       prints corrections + a REVIEW list of brand disagreements it was
       not confident enough to auto-fix (the agent reconciles those by
       hand, with the script in front of it).

What counts as a brand name
----------------------------
A script token is brand-like if it: contains a digit (v0, GPT-4); has
internal uppercase (OpenClaw); is ALL-CAPS len>1 (API); or is capitalized
AND not sentence-initial (Hermes, Bolt). Sentence-initial caps ("Three
made…") are NOT brands.

How it stays safe
-----------------
The two token streams are diffed (difflib). Corrections happen only inside
`replace` spans (a local disagreement), and only:
  • per-token, when the spans are equal-length — swap the brand tokens.
  • wholesale, when a short span is ENTIRELY brand tokens but garbled into
    a different token count ("Open Claw" 2 → "OpenClaw" 1).
  • edge-peel, when a brand sits at a list boundary confirmed by a matching
    (`equal`) run right next to it — pair the edge tokens 1:1.
Anything else containing a brand the script disagrees with is not touched —
it is printed under REVIEW for the agent to reconcile. Numbers, ordinary
words, whole re-phrasings and skipped script lines are always left alone.
