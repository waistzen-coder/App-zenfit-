"""
Snap each beat's start_sec / end_sec to the actual spoken-word boundaries.

Plans authored by hand have approximate timings. The eye is unforgiving
about the visual being half a second early or late. This script reads each
beat's `speech_anchor` (the exact phrase the speaker says when the visual
should be on screen) and looks it up in words.json:

  start_sec = first matched word's `start` − LEAD_SEC
  end_sec   = last  matched word's `end`   + TAIL_SEC

For `quote_pull` beats it ALSO sets `chars_per_second` so the typewriter
finishes around the same moment the speaker finishes the quote (within ±5%).

If a beat lacks `speech_anchor`, it's left alone.

Idempotent. Run after sync_list_items.py and before close_gaps.py.
