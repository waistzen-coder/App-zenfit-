# plan/timing/asset/caption/followcam data, freshly rebuilt above), every
# template source file, and the source video's mtime. If the fingerprint
# matches the last SUCCESSFUL render AND the output file still exists, the
# render would be byte-for-byte identical — skip it. This is what makes
# re-running an already-done scene in a batch instant, and what makes a
# crash-resume not re-render the scenes that already finished.
