Transcribe a video to word-level timestamps via WhisperX.
Output: <video>.workdir/words.json -> [{"word", "start", "end"}, ...]

IMPORTANT: this script MUST run inside the .venv at
`~/.claude/skills/video-edit/.venv/` because WhisperX has heavy
dependencies (faster-whisper, pyannote, etc.) that we don't want in
the system Python. The shebang at the top points to `/usr/bin/env
python3`; if a caller invokes the system python directly, we
auto-relaunch under the venv interpreter so the import doesn't fail
with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'whisperx'`.

NOTE: this venv is intentionally SHARED with the sibling `video-edit`
skill rather than duplicated here (it's ~1.3GB — torch + pyannote +
faster-whisper). Both skills transcribe the same way; there's nothing
skill-specific about WhisperX itself. Don't scope a separate venv per
skill unless the dependency set actually diverges.

# mishearings — where the wrong word IS a real word and can only be fixed by
# the phrase around it. e.g. "caught their costs" is nonsense ("caught the
# wave" elsewhere is correct) — only the 3-word phrase disambiguates it.
#
# Each entry: (wrong_tokens, right_tokens), SAME length. Matching is
# lower-cased + punctuation-stripped; on a hit, each word's text is rewritten
# (capitalization + trailing punctuation of the original preserved).
#
# Add new mishearings here as they show up — it's the channel's correction
# memory. Transcription is never perfect; this is the deterministic patch.
